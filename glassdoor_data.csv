Our team takes a pragmatic approach to Data Science, defining it loosely as the intersection of technical expertise, business acumen, and soft skills to solve business problems with data. We spend a lot of time trying to understand the problem before we set about building a solution, and we prefer lower tech useful solutions over shiny algorithms and dust on the shelf.

The software and technology you’ll use to do that – Databricks, AWS, and MLflow, to name a few – are slightly more advanced than the oil-based ink Gutenberg used, but they’ll serve the same purpose: making information and data available and useful to SAIF employees and customers on a scale yet unseen.
With your experience and skills in automating the deployment of data science models and building repeatable pipelines, you’ll help us address complex issues like worker safety, fraud, and the evolving customer experience.
